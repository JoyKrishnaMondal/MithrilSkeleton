###Mithril Skeleton App Using LiveScript.

Boilerplate code for creating apps using Mithril with LiveScript.

###How To use

If you want to set up a new mithril project 

```
git clone https://github.com/JoyKrishnaMondal/MithrilSkeleton
```

you will also need to set up a browserify watch to compile your static assets. 

You could use your own preferred modules but I have written [one](https://github.com/JoyKrishnaMondal/SimpleBrowserifyWatch) that uses javascript header files.
